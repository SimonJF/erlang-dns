Erlang/OTP DNS server

Folks, don't use this yet. This is a first commit and will echo your DNS query back at best. You're welcome to follow of course to see a novice Erlanger craft and burn.

I am planning to use the undocumented gen_dns module to handle most of the heavy lifting. In particular gen_dns:decode/? and gen_dns:encode/? should proof handy. 

This project is will morph into something useful to use with my site domain-name-registration.co.za. Positive affirmations rock!
